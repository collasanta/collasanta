Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding for over 5 years and moved from traditional finance and banks to work with fullstack development and blockchain/DeFi.

I started by automating Excel Sheets with VBA in my first internship, fell in love with code, and decided to become a developer since then.

Over these years I've experimented with diverse fields, ranging from standard frontend, backend, and DevOps development, to more edge tech like smart-contracts and AI stuff.

I also like to put my knowledge to work and build useful open-source applications. 

You can check some of my projects and code in the public repo space.
