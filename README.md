Hi there 👋

💻 I started my journey by automating Excel Sheets in Visual Basic at my first internship, fell in love with code, and have been coding since then.

🌐 Over these years I've experimented with diverse fields, ranging from the standard frontend, backend, and cloud development, and have been focusing on Blockchain and AI.

🌟 I'm just starting my journey, there is a lot to learn!
